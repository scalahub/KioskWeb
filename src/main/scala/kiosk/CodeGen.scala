    """This is front-end for Kiosk, which is a library for interacting with the Ergo blockchain.
      |Kiosk is built on top of Ergo-AppKit and provides the ability to send transactions by spending
      |arbitrary boxes (provided their script allows them to be spent) and creating boxes with arbitrary guard scripts.
      |In order to create a script that hard-wires constants (such as a group element), first create a named constant
      |in the environment of the correct type. Then reference that name in the script code. To add that constant to a
      |register, use that name as part of the registerKeys array when creating a box.
      |
      |This is a multi-tenant version of Kiosk, where each URL uniquely determines an environment. Variables and
      |boxes in one environment are independent of those in other environments. Thus, multiple users may use Kiosk without
      |mixing up their environments as long as they use different URLs.
      |When visiting the bare base URL, the system automatically redirects to a randomly generated new URL.
      |
      |To get a new environment, simply use a new end-URL, either by visiting the bare base URL or manually creating one.
      |Note that environments are not saved to disk so the garbage collector may clear unused environments.""".stripMargin
